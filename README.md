# Sony Camera Website Concept
This project is a minimalist and aesthetic website concept for Sony cameras, 
designed with a black, white, and light gray color scheme. As a huge fan of Sony cameras 
(and a proud owner of one), I focused exclusively on showcasing Sony Camera products. 
The site was created as an exercise to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
